Description: The goal of ReverseGWAS is to find associations between complex phenotypes and genotypes in a multi-phenotype GWAS. If we remove the word 'complex', this becomes identical to the standard GWAS problem of finding genotype-phenotype associations. If we move the word 'complex' next to 'genotypes', this becomes identical to the problem solved by a genetic risk score (GRS). In other words, analogously to a GRS, ReverseGWAS seeks combinations of phenotypes that are simultaneously associated with a SNP. Other than reversing genotype and phenotype, the key difference with a GRS is that ReverseGWAS combines the phenotypes logically.
